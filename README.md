## Future Updates

### Polish 
- 3D Modelling and Animation of the people and the world they inhabit. 
- User Interface: better transitions between stages and a better dialogue system.

### Limiting Function Usage
- As of now, a player can use as many functions as they want on whoever they want, hence we will have to limit certain functions to certain kinds of people as well as limit the number of functions used in general. 

### Long-Term Goal
- Make different kinds of games showcasing different CS 18000 concepts to help more students learn through graphical experiences beyond the internet or the textbook.
