# String Of Murders
**Version 2.1**

A game project to help students learn Java coding syntax.

Specifically java string functions for now. The user will attempt to solve a murder mystery using his super power of changing and viewing the strings attached to each person in the game world.

Start the game not knowing anything about the murderer or the citizens.

The user can click on people and run functions like length(), charAt() or contains() to find out things about the string of each person.

## Future Updates

### Polish 
- 3D Modelling and Animation of the people and the world they inhabit. 
- User Interface: better transitions between stages and a better dialogue system.

### Limiting Function Usage
- As of now, a player can use as many functions as they want on whoever they want, hence we will have to limit certain functions to certain kinds of people as well as limit the number of functions used in general. 

### Long-Term Goal
- Make different kinds of games showcasing different CS 18000 concepts to help more students learn through graphical experiences beyond the internet or the textbook.

## Lessons Learnt

### Visualization 
- [Mr Gustavo](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/grr) made a strong suggestion, when choosing to teach about programming concepts, we should keep in mind that visualization is the most helpful thing beyond reading and listening. For future updates, we should always try to help the player visualize as much as possible from the gameplay presented.

### Dynamic Gameplay
- We could use with much more movement from the characters in the world as well as the quest dialogues. Currently too static and lacking liveliness. 
- Also lacks difficulty (in reference to function usage mentioned earlier).

### Minor Details
- We should arrange our game objects in the future based on their function, especially if we're making them all randomized based on function later on. For example, our people had to be arranged a second time in efficient but confusing way for people who doesn't know what the values mean. 
- Make the rules much clearer, taking out unnecessary details.
